## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MySQL** (Running instance)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/recipe-radar.git
   cd recipe-radar
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup the Database**
   - Start your MySQL server.
   - Create the `Recipe_Radar` database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE Recipe_Radar;

     USE Recipe_Radar;

     CREATE TABLE users (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
         password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=Recipe_Radar
   SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key
   ```

   Replace `your_password` and `your_spoonacular_api_key` with your actual database password and Spoonacular API key.

5. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

6. **Access the Application**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## API Integration

The app fetches recipe data using the **Spoonacular API**. To obtain an API key:
1. Visit [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and sign up.
2. Generate an API key in your account dashboard.
3. Add the key to your `.env` file.

Example API request:
```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = process.env.SPOONACULAR_API_KEY;
const searchQuery = "chicken";

axios.get(`https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/complexSearch?query=${searchQuery}&apiKey=${apiKey}`)
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```
